# Synthetic Data Tutorials - by MOSTLY AI

Welcome! We're excited to share our repository of tutorials with you, which will help you explore and validate the benefits of synthetic data. Simply clone the repository to your own environment and run it locally via Jupyter Lab, or make it even easier and run each tutorial directly on Google's cloud resources via Colab. Let's get started!

* Validate synthetic data via **Train-Synthetic-Test-Real** [[run on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/blob/dev/train-synthetic-test-real/TSTR.ipynb)]
* Explore the **size vs. accuracy trade-off** for synthetic data [[run on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/blob/dev/size-vs-accuracy/size-vs-accuracy.ipynb)]
* **Rebalance** synthetic datasets for data augmentation [[run on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/blob/dev/rebalancing/rebalancing.ipynb)]
* **Conditionally generate** synthetic (geo) data [[run on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/blob/dev/conditional-generation/conditional-generation.ipynb)]
* **Explain AI**  with synthetic data [[run on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/blob/dev/explainable-ai/explainable-ai.ipynb)]
* Generate **synthetic text** [[run on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/blob/dev/synthetic-text/synthetic-text.ipynb)]
* Perform **multi-table synthesis** [[run on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/blob/dev/multi-table/multi-table.ipynb)]
* Develop a **fake or real discriminator** with Synthetic Data [[run on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/blob/dev/fake-or-real/fake-or-real.ipynb)]
* Close gaps in your data with **Smart Imputation** [[run on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/blob/dev/smart-imputation/smart-imputation.ipynb)]

    "# Conditional Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show how to generate samples that are conditioned on specific values for a set of attributes. By that, we effectively create partially synthetic data, where synthetic attributes are randomly sampled given the context of a handful of pre-determined fixed attributes. Note, that the synthetic data is still statistically representative, but within the given context. The privacy of the overall dataset is then largely dependend on the privacy of the provided fixed attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate conditional generation for two use cases:\n",
    "1. First, we generate synthetic data for the UCI Adult Income, but will probe the model for an equal gender split and an uncorrelated income attribute. I.e., we will remove the gender income gap, and see how the other attributes will change accordingly.\n",
    "1. Secondly, we create partially synthetic data for AirBnB listings in Manhattan, where the locations will then be actual locations, yet all other attributes are synthetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./conditional-generation.png\" width=\"550px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform either scenario, we split the original data table into two tables, that are linked together via a unique key. If that unique key does not exist yet, we will have to add one as part of pre-processing. The first table shall contain all columns, that we want to hold fixed. This table will then be uploaded as our subject table. The second table contains all other columns, that are then synthesized in the context of the first table. Once, the model is trained, we can then proceed to \"Generate more data\", and upload the seed context with the fixed attributes and an ID column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the same kind of conditional generation can also be performed for two-table setups. The process is even easier in that case, as the pre- and post-processing steps are not required. Once a two-table model is trained, one can simply generate more data, and provide a new subject table as the seed for the linked table."

This allows you to probe the generative model with a specific context, whether that is hypothetical (use case 1) or real (use case 2), and gain corresponding insights for specific scenarios.\n",

    "* to generate a very large number of records for a fixed value set, e.g. create 1 million records of 48 year old female Professors\n",

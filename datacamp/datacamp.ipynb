    "# Datacamp Webinar\n",
    "\n",
    "In this webinar, we demonstrate the process of evaluating the quality of synthetic data based on its utility for a downstream Machine Learning (ML) task. The method is commonly referred to as the Train-Synthetic-Test-Real (TSTR) evaluation [[1](#refs)]. The TSTR evaluation serves as a robust measure of synthetic data quality because ML models rely on the accurate representation of deeper underlying patterns to perform effectively on previously unseen data. As a result, this approach offers a more reliable assessment than simply evaluating higher-level statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "See image below for the general setup of TSTR.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/dev/train-synthetic-test-real/TSTR.png' width=\"600px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we take actual (=real) data, and split it into a holdout and a training dataset. Next, we create a synthetic dataset only based on the training data. Then we train a Machine Learning (ML) model, and do so once using the synthetic data and once using the actual training data. And finally we evaluate the performance of each of those two models on top of the actual holdout data, that was kept aside all along. By comparing the performance of these two models, we can assess how much utility has been retained by the synthesization method with respect to a specific ML task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that one needs to use a true holdout for the evaluation to properly measure out-of-sample performance, as this is the relevant metric for real-world use cases. If one uses the same training data that has been used for the synthesis, one would \"leak\" information from training into evaluation. This becomes particularly an issue for synthesizers that are prone to overfitting, and simply memorize the samples that it has been exposed to. If one, on the other hand, were to use synthetic data for the evaluation, one would not get meaningful results either, as the synthetic data might not be representative of the real data. E.g., consider the degenerate case of a synthesizer that only produces the same record over and over again. Any model trained on that data, would yield perfect results when evaluated on it again, whereas it will be of no use when applied to real data."

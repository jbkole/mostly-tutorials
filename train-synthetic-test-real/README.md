# Train-Synthetic-Test-Real

In this tutorial, we show how to assess synthetic data quality with respect to its utility for a downstream Machine Learning (ML) task. The demonstrated 
approach is also known as the Train-Synthetic-Test-Real (TSTR) evaluation. It is a strong test for the quality of generated synthetic data, 
as machine learning models require deeper hidden structures being faithfully represented in order to be effective on new unseen data. Thus, it can serve 
as a stronger test than relying merely on assessing higher-level statistics.
